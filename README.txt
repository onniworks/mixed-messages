# Welcome to this README file

## Project plan
Every time a user runs my program, they should get a new, randomized output. To make my program truly random, the message that it outputs will be made up of at least three different pieces of data. 
I will build the project by using:
- JavaScript
- Git version control
- Command line
- VS Code

## Message topics
The output of my messages will be **Ancient Shamanic Wisdoms&**
